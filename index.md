### About Us
A free to attend all inclusive group of people with the occasional dog (location dependant). We meet on the first **Monday** of the month (*except when we don't*) to talk about all things tech and infosec. Talks topics range from Blue teaming, Red teaming, hardware hacking, cryptography, to personal projects. If you would like to **give a talk** DM us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dc441242) or complete this [form](https://forms.gle/EaoRV8RJnvN7o9sP8).


### Events

Usually on Zoom. We will go back to in-person or a hybrid Zoom/in-person meets as the pandemic allows.
